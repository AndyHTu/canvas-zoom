An extension of [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

Adds the ability to zoom into Inpaint, Sketch, and Inpaint Sketch.

Shortcuts:

**Shift + wheel(hold)** - Move canvas

**Shift + wheel** - Scale canvas

**Ctr + wheel** - Change brush size

**R** - Reset Zoom.

**O** - Overlap all elements and back


When you move the mouse beyond the picture boundary, the last action is canceled

**Known bugs:**

If you click on the cross and delete the picture in zoom mode, there is a chance that the picture will be cropped. It is necessary to click on the cross and load the picture again without zooming, then everything will work as it should.
